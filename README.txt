# Library-System

INSTRUCTIONS:

Two default accounts are 'built-in' to this program:
  ADMIN:
    username: Jane
    password: Doe
  USER:
    username: John
    password: Doe
These accounts are simply here for testing purposes and creating the first user(s).

'Input Files':
Other than States.txt, the files in this directory are all dummy information for testing purposes, and should be replaced before deployment.

'Persistent':
This is where all the Library data is stored (Users, Admins, Books, overdues, etc.) so that everything is saved when the program is closed.

This program is structured using the typical MVC Design Pattern.
